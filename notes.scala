'a' 
// characters type is char and character literals are written in single quotes

0.1
//res1: Double = 0.1
//The type is called Double and is for floating point numbers (decimals) and are an approx of real numbers
//A double takes up approx 64 bits, not enough to store infinite
//In general, floating point numbers can lead to nasty surprises if you expect them to act like the reals. 
//They are fine for our purposes in Creative Scala, but donâ€™t go using them to write accounting software!
//In Scala all values are objects, operations like +,- are the object's methods
//we interact with objects by calling/invoking methods
//some methods accept parameters or arguements
//a method call is an expression and evaluates to an object



//Method call syntax anExpression.methodName(paramIfAny)

1 + 2
1. + (2)

//In Scala, these are equivalent, second way is known as operator style
//a b c d e 
// a.b(c).d(e)

//One use of types is stopping us from calling methods that don't exist, type of an expression tells the compiler what methods exist on the value it evaluates to
//code won't compile if we try to call to a method that doesn't exist

// = 7, Scala does maintain the standard precedence rule

1 + ("Moonage daydream".indexOf("N"))
//res8: Int = 0, can't find indexof("N") because there is no capital N, 
//when can't find, it evaluates to -1, 1+ -1 = 0

1 / 1 + ("Moonage daydream".indexOf("N"))
//res9: Int=0
//according to precedence 1/1 + (-1) evals to 0
